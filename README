Jenkins build status display on a LED strip, powered by an Arduino!

Needs Adafruit NeoPixel library:
    https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel
I recommend Ino for compiling/running Arduino sketches from the command line:
    http://inotool.org/

Unfortunately this is not yet autonomous -- I don't have an Ethernet shield.
To feed the data to the Arduino, you'll need a computer with Python and some
Python libraries (see requirements.txt).


Wire a WS2812 (NeoPixel) strip's data wire to pin 7, connect power and ground.
Change the NUM_LEDS #define to the number of LEDs in your strip.


Compile & upload to an Arduino.
I use the `ino` wrapper, so this means:
    ino build && ino upload

Make note of the serial console Arduino is connected to.

Then run the data feeder script:
If Arduino is connected to /dev/ttyACM0, that would be something like:
    python feed-data.py http://jenkins.yourdomain.example/ /dev/ttyACM0

Enjoy the show!

Pull requests welcome!
